# JavaScript Frameworks

---

# What is a framework?

- A framework is a library that offers **opinions** about how software gets built.
- These opinions allow for **predictability** and **homogeneity** in an application.
  - Predictability allows software to scale to an enormous size and still be maintainable.
  - Predictability and maintainability are essential for the health and longevity of software.

---

# Imperative and declarative programming

- **Imperative**
  - Tell a computer how to do something.
- **Declarative**
  - Describe to a computer what you want.

---

# To do this

---

# Imperative programming

- JavaScript

```javascript
const ul = document.createElement('ul');
for (let i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
  const li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = `List ${i}`;
  ul.appendChild(li);
}
document.body.appendChild(ul);
```

---

# Declarative

- Just use HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li>List 1</li>
  <li>List 2</li>
  <li>List 3</li>
</ul>
```

---

# But...

- `HTML` only works for static site.
- For dynamic web application, a **framework** can help us write code more **declaratively**.

---

# Vanilla JS or Framework?

- Vanilla JS
  - A less complex site, for example a personal to-do list or a site that displays mostly static content
- Framework
  - A large site with a complex UI. Frameworks provide solutions to common problems that would take an absurd amount of time and patience to implement with pure JavaScript.

# Job market

- https://th.jobsdb.com
- Try searching for `React`, `Vue`, `Angular`, ...

---

# React

---

# JSX

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

- This is neither a string nor HTML.
- It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. - - This tells React to describe what the UI should look like.
- JSX produces React “elements”.
- [Source](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

# Virtual DOM

- Virtual DOM (VDOM) represents the DOM tree in memory.
- VDOM performs calculations and decides which elements of the actual DOM should be mutated.
  - Faster performance.

# Rendering process

- Rendering is a process that is triggered by a change of state in some component of your application, when a state change occurs React.
- See illustration in [Source](https://dev.to/teo_garcia/understanding-rendering-in-react-i5i).

# Get started with `react`

https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
