# Asynchronous Programming (Part 1)

---

# Motivation

- Normally, a given program's code runs straight along, with only one thing happening at once.
- If a function relies on the result of another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish and return.
  - And until that happens, the entire program is essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.
- This is **synchronous programming**.

---

# Motivation

- synchronicity can lead to frustrating experience for a user.
- Also it might not be a good use of computer processing power.
  - Computers have multiple processor cores available.
  - We should let the other task get processed on another processor core and let us know when it's done.
- This is the basis of **asynchronous programming**.

---

# Environment

- It is up to the programming environment you are using (web browsers, in the case of web development) to provide you with APIs that allow you to run such tasks asynchronously.

---

# Synchronous JavaScript

- A lot of the functionality we have larned are synchronous.

---

```html
<button>Click me</button>
```

```javascript
const btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('You clicked me!');

  let pElem = document.createElement('p');
  pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
  document.body.appendChild(pElem);
});
```

---

# Blocking code

- When a web app runs in a browser and it executes an intensive chunk of code without returning control to the browser, the browser can appear to be frozen.
- This is called **blocking**.

---

```javascript
const btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Expensive calculations
  let myDate;
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
    let date = new Date();
    myDate = date;
  }
  console.log(myDate);
  // -->

  let pElem = document.createElement('p');
  pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
  document.body.appendChild(pElem);
});
```

---

# Side note: thread

- JavaScript, generally speaking, is **single-threaded**.
- A thread is basically a single process that a program can use to complete tasks. Each thread can only do a single task at once.
- Even with multiple cores, you could only get it to run tasks on a single thread, called the **main thread**.

---

# What happened?

- The code above contains all synchronous tasks.
- Tasks are executed sequentially.

```
Main Thread: Task A --> Task B --> Task C --> Task D ...
```

---

# Asynchronous javascript

- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`

---

# `setTimeout`

```javascript
const btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Asynchronous task
  setTimeout(() => alert('I waited.'), 3000);
  //
  let pElem = document.createElement('p');
  pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
  document.body.appendChild(pElem);
});
```

---

# What happened?

- `setTimeout` cause the "task" (callback function) be to asynchronous.

```
Main Thread: Fire Handler --(Skip alert)--> Show paragraph --(After 3 seconds)--> Show alert.
```

---

# Passing extra argument

```javascript
setTimeout(() => alert('I waited'), 3000);

// Or

setTimeout(alert, 3000, 'I waited');
```

---

# What is the value of `x` from `alert`?

```javascript
let x = 10;
setTimeout(alert, 3000, x);
x = 20;
console.log(x);
```

```javascript
let x = 10;
setTimeout(() => alert(x), 3000);
x = 20;
console.log(x);
```

---

# `setInterval`

```html
<p id="clock"></p>
<button>Click me</button>
```

---

```javascript
const clock = document.querySelector('#clock');
// Asynchronous task
setInterval(() => {
  const date = new Date();
  clock.textContent = date.toLocaleTimeString();
}, 1000);

const btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  let pElem = document.createElement('p');
  pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
  document.body.appendChild(pElem);
});
```

- If `setInterval` did not create a asynchronous task, the button would not work!

---

# `clearInterval`

```html
<p id="clock"></p>
<button id="start">Start Clock</button>
<button id="stop">Stop Clock</button>
```

---

```javascript
const clock = document.querySelector('#clock');
const btnStart = document.querySelector('#start');
const btnStop = document.querySelector('#stop');

let timer;
btnStart.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Asynchronous task
  timer = setInterval(() => {
    const date = new Date();
    clock.textContent = date.toLocaleTimeString();
  }, 1000);
});

btnStop.addEventListener('click', () => {
  clearInterval(timer);
});
```

---

# Async callbacks

- Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start executing code in the background.
- When the background code finishes running, it calls the callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened.
- Using callbacks is slightly old-fashioned now, but you'll still see them in use in a number of lder-but-still-commonly-used APIs.
